/**
 * Regression test — matchesParsedArea (#66).
 *
 * When the mower re-uploads its map after mowing, each parsed area must match
 * the existing DB row for that zone by its STABLE canonical slot (map0/map1/…),
 * NOT by the user alias in map_name. Matching on the alias meant a renamed map
 * ("test") no longer matched its map2 area on re-upload: the alias was reset to
 * the default label and a duplicate row was created while the renamed row was
 * deleted as stale. This test locks the canonical-slot match.
