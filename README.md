# OpenNova — Self-hosted Novabot Cloud Replacement

Replace the Novabot cloud with your own local server. Your mower and charging station connect to **your server** on your own network — no cloud dependency, no outages, full control.

!!! The Novabot cloud has been experiencing frequent outages since March 2026. OpenNova keeps your mower operational regardless of cloud status.

## What is OpenNova?

A single Docker container that includes everything your Novabot needs:

- **MQTT Broker** (port 1883) — mower and charger connect here
- **Cloud API** (ports 80/443) — compatible with the official Novabot app
- **DNS Server** (optional) — redirects `mqtt.lfibot.com` to your server
- **TLS/HTTPS** (optional) — for iOS Novabot app compatibility

The official Novabot app continues to work — it just talks to your server instead of the cloud.

## Quick Start

### 1. Pull the Docker image

```bash
docker pull rvbcrs/opennova:latest
```

### 2. Create docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  opennova:
    image: rvbcrs/opennova:latest
    container_name: opennova
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"       # HTTP (API + admin panel + mower connectivity check)
      - "443:443"     # HTTPS (required for Novabot app)
      - "1883:1883"   # MQTT broker
    environment:
      PORT: 80
      ENABLE_TLS: "true"
    volumes:
      - novabot-data:/data

volumes:
  novabot-data:
```

> **Important**: Port 443 and `ENABLE_TLS=true` are required for the official Novabot app. The app connects via HTTPS to `app.lfibot.com`. Without TLS, the app will show "network connection is abnormal".

### 3. Start the server

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify it's running

```bash
curl http://localhost/api/setup/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"server":"ok","mqtt":"ok"}
```

### 5. Set up DNS redirect

> **Custom firmware?** Auto-discovery via mDNS may already work without any DNS
> setup — see [docs/guide/auto-discovery.md](docs/guide/auto-discovery.md).
> The DNS options below are required for stock firmware.

Your mower needs to find your server when it looks up `mqtt.lfibot.com`. You have several options:

#### Option A: Pi-hole / AdGuard Home (recommended)

Add DNS rewrites in your Pi-hole or AdGuard admin panel:

| Domain | IP Address |
|--------|-----------|
| `mqtt.lfibot.com` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` |
| `app.lfibot.com` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` |

Then point your router's DHCP DNS to your Pi-hole/AdGuard IP.

#### Option B: Router DNS override

Some routers (Fritz!Box, ASUS) support custom DNS records. Add entries for `mqtt.lfibot.com` and `app.lfibot.com` pointing to your server IP.

#### Option C: Built-in DNS (simplest)

Enable the built-in DNS server in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "1883:1883"
  - "53:53/udp"       # DNS
environment:
  PORT: 80
  ENABLE_DNS: "true"
  TARGET_IP: "192.168.0.100"   # Your server's LAN IP
```

Then point your router's DHCP DNS server to your server IP.

#### Verify DNS is working

From any device on your network:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
dig mqtt.lfibot.com +short

# Windows
nslookup mqtt.lfibot.com
```

Should return your server IP. If it shows `47.253.145.99` (Novabot cloud), DNS is not redirected yet.

### 6. Open the Novabot app and log in

That's it! Open the official Novabot app on your phone and log in with your normal Novabot account. The server will:

1. **Detect you're a new user** (not yet in the local database)
2. **Forward your login to the Novabot cloud** to verify your credentials
3. **Automatically create your local account** (first user becomes admin)
4. **Import your devices** from the cloud

From this point on, the app talks to your local server. Your mower and charger connect via MQTT on port 1883.

> **Tip:** Restart your mower after setting up DNS — power off, wait 10 seconds, power on. It will pick up the new DNS and connect to your server.

Check the server logs to confirm:

```bash
docker compose logs -f opennova | grep CONNECT
```

You should see your mower's serial number (LFIN...) connecting.

### Fallback: Admin Panel

If the automatic login doesn't work (e.g., Novabot cloud is down), you can use the admin panel:

1. Open **http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/admin** in your browser
2. On first visit with an empty database, you'll see a **"Welcome to OpenNova"** setup page
3. Enter your Novabot cloud email + password to import your account and devices
4. Or click **"Skip"** to create a local account (admin@local / admin)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `80` | Internal HTTP port |
| `ENABLE_DNS` | `false` | Enable built-in DNS redirect |
| `TARGET_IP` | — | Your server's LAN IP (required for DNS/TLS) |
| `UPSTREAM_DNS` | `8.8.8.8` | Fallback DNS server |
| `ENABLE_TLS` | `false` | Enable HTTPS for iOS Novabot app |
| `ENABLE_DASHBOARD` | `false` | Enable web dashboard (beta, not for public use yet) |

### Optional: Home Assistant Integration

Bridge mower data to Home Assistant via MQTT auto-discovery:

```yaml
environment:
  HA_MQTT_HOST: "192.168.0.200"
  HA_MQTT_PORT: 1883
  HA_MQTT_USER: "mqtt"
  HA_MQTT_PASS: "mqtt"
  RENDER_BASE_URL: "http://192.168.0.222"   # publieke URL van OpenNova; vereist voor live map-tile in HA
```

Entities auto-appear in Home Assistant under the mower/charger serial number — sensors (battery, GPS, error, msg, …) plus a live `image` entity that shows a server-rendered PNG of the mower map.

### Optional: ntfy Push Notifications (free, no account)

Get a push on your phone whenever the mower starts/finishes mowing, docks, runs into an error, or hits low battery.

1. Pick a unique topic name (long + random — anyone subscribed can read your events). Example: `novabot-ramon-x7k9q`.
2. Add to `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     NTFY_TOPIC: "novabot-ramon-x7k9q"
     NTFY_URL: "https://ntfy.sh"          # default; change for self-hosted
     NTFY_PRIORITY: "4"                   # optional, 1..5
   ```
3. Restart: `docker compose up -d`.
4. Install the **ntfy** app from the App Store / Play Store (free, no account).
5. Subscribe to your topic in the app.

You'll receive notifications for every detected event — start/stop/dock/error/safety/PIN-locked/low battery/GPS issue/etc. Each push has a category tag (e.g. `mower,stuck`) so you can filter inside ntfy.

#### Tuning what triggers a push

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD` | `20` | Battery % crossing point for `low_battery` event (one-shot per dip) |
| `EVENTS_MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX` | `novabot/events` | Topic prefix for the local MQTT event publishes (HA picks these up) |

Events also flow to:
- **Local MQTT** at `novabot/events/<SN>` and `novabot/events/<SN>/<event_type>` — Home Assistant's MQTT integration auto-discovers; use as automation trigger.
- **HA webhook** if `HA_WEBHOOK_URL` is set — full event JSON POSTed to your HA webhook trigger.
- **HTTP polling** at `GET /api/events/<SN>?limit=50` — last 200 events per mower, JSON.
- **Stock Novabot app inbox** — events also land in the app's Settings → Messages tab on the next poll, with the same English text the Novabot cloud would have shown.

### iOS Setup (Novabot iOS App)

The Novabot iOS app requires HTTPS — it won't connect over plain HTTP. You need to enable TLS and install a certificate profile on your iPhone.

#### Step 1: Enable TLS in Docker

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "1883:1883"
  - "443:443"         # HTTPS for iOS
environment:
  PORT: 80
  ENABLE_TLS: "true"
  TARGET_IP: "192.168.0.100"   # Your server's LAN IP
```

Restart the container:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

A self-signed TLS certificate is automatically generated on first start.

#### Step 2: Download the Configuration Profile

Open **Safari** on your iPhone and go to:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/api/setup/profile
```

(Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your server's actual IP address, e.g., `http://192.168.0.100/api/setup/profile`)

Safari will prompt you to download `OpenNova.mobileconfig`. Tap **Allow**.

This profile includes:
- **DNS settings** — routes DNS through your OpenNova server
- **CA Certificate** — trusts your server's self-signed TLS certificate

#### Step 3: Install the Profile

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone
2. You'll see **"Profile Downloaded"** near the top — tap it
3. Tap **Install** (top right)
4. Enter your iPhone passcode
5. Tap **Install** again on the warning screen
6. Tap **Done**

#### Step 4: Trust the Certificate

1. Go to **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**
2. Find **"OpenNova CA Certificate"**
3. Toggle it **ON**
4. Tap **Continue** on the warning

#### Step 5: Verify

Open the Novabot app on your iPhone. It should now connect to your local server instead of the cloud.

> **To remove later**: Go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → OpenNova → Remove Profile

### Android Setup (Novabot Android App)

Android is simpler — **no certificate needed**. Just set up DNS (see above) and the Novabot app will connect to your server automatically.

If your mower is already connected to WiFi and DNS is redirected, restart the mower and it will connect to your server. The Android app will then communicate via your server.

## Data & Backup

All data is stored in the `novabot-data` Docker volume:

```bash
# Backup
docker compose cp opennova:/data ./opennova-backup

# Restore
docker compose cp ./opennova-backup/. opennova:/data
docker compose restart opennova
```

## Upgrading

```bash
docker pull rvbcrs/opennova:latest
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup.

## Troubleshooting

### Mower not connecting

1. **Check DNS**: `dig mqtt.lfibot.com +short` should show your server IP
2. **Check MQTT port**: `nc -zv YOUR_SERVER_IP 1883` should succeed
3. **Check logs**: `docker compose logs opennova | grep MQTT`
4. **WiFi**: Mower only supports **2.4 GHz** — 5 GHz networks are invisible to it
5. **Restart mower**: Power off, wait 10s, power on (picks up new DNS from router)

### Port 53 conflict (Linux)

```bash
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
```

### Container won't start

```bash
docker compose logs opennova
```

Common issues: port 1883 already in use (another MQTT broker), missing TARGET_IP.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Novabot N1000 Mower | Fully supported |
| Novabot N2000 Mower | Fully supported |
| Novabot Charging Station | Fully supported |

## ⚠️ Custom firmware (BETA)

> **⚠️ BETA — Custom firmware is experimentele software.**
> Het kan je maaier onbruikbaar maken (**bricken**) en **AL je kaarten wissen**.
> OpenNova maakt automatisch een verse backup vóór elke beta-flash (server-side, max. 24u oud),
> maar installeer alleen als je de risico's accepteert.

Custom firmware builds (`*-custom-*` / `*-opennova-*`) add features such as SSH access, local server autodiscovery, and remote ROS 2 access — but they are **not stable releases**. Build with `research/build_custom_firmware.sh`. OTA delivery goes via the OpenNova dashboard or the Novabot app.

## What's Next

We're working on additional tools (not yet ready for public release):

- **OpenNova App** — dedicated mobile app (iOS/Android) that doesn't need DNS redirects
- **Bootstrap Tool** — desktop app for easy first-time Bluetooth provisioning
- **ESP32 OTA Tool** — standalone hardware device for provisioning + custom firmware
- **Open source firmware modules** — replacing closed-source binaries on the mower
