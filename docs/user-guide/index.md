# User Guide

Welcome. This section is for **mower owners** — people who bought a Novabot, lost (or want to leave) the LFI cloud, and want their mower to keep working forever on their own network.

It does **not** assume you have Docker experience, know what a JWT is, or want to read decompiled firmware. The Wiki's other tabs (HTTP API, MQTT Protocol, BLE Protocol, Firmware) exist for developers and reverse-engineers; this tab is for everyone else.

## What is OpenNova?

A local replacement for the Novabot cloud servers. Once it runs on your network:

- Your **Novabot app keeps working** without LFI's servers being online.
- The mower talks to **your** server instead of `mqtt.lfibot.com`.
- Maps, schedules, work history, and OTA updates all stay inside your house.
- New community features (multi-user, dashboards, Home Assistant, push notifications) are added on top.

If LFI shuts down their cloud tomorrow, your mower keeps running. If their cloud is already gone for you, OpenNova brings it back.

## What hardware does it need?

A small always-on computer to run the server. Anything works as long as it has Docker:

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Synology / QNAP / ZimaOS / TrueNAS | Easiest — install Docker, run one container |
| Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 | Cheap, low power, sits in a drawer |
| Old laptop or PC running Linux | Free if you already have one |
| Mac mini / Mac with Docker Desktop | Works for testing, but [mDNS is limited](#known-limitations) — better to run on Linux |
| Windows PC running Docker | Same mDNS caveat as Mac |

You do **not** need a powerful machine. The mower does the hard work — the server just stores data and routes messages.

## LFI Knowledge Base archive

Before LFI shut down their cloud, all their official manuals, FAQ entries, and error-code explanations lived on `lfibot.zendesk.com`. That site can go offline at any time, so we extracted the full content via the Zendesk API on 2026-03-08 and kept a local copy:

**[LFI Knowledge Base (archived)](../reference/NOVABOT-ZENDESK-WIKI.md)** — installation, charger placement, mapping, schedules, OTA, every error code from the original manual. The content is in Dutch (translated from the original) and is what most non-technical questions are answered by.

## How help works

There is **no LFI support hotline** for OpenNova users. The community handles support:

- **Bug?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rvbcrs/Novabot/issues/new/choose).
- **Question?** Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rvbcrs/Novabot/discussions).
- **Logs to share?** Use the **Remote Support** card in your admin page — that gives Ramon (the project maintainer) a one-session, you-approved shell into your container to diagnose. Every keystroke is logged on **your** disk for review.

Before filing an issue: skim [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). Most "mower offline" or "no maps" reports are one of the same five things.

## Known limitations

- **Mac / Windows Docker Desktop has limited mDNS.** Auto-discovery (`opennova.local`) may not work because the container runs inside a Linux VM. You can still use the server — just configure DNS manually so the mower knows where to find it.
- **iOS app requires a real TLS certificate** for the Novabot stock app to connect (Apple blocks self-signed). The admin page has a Certificate Setup card that installs an OpenNova CA on the phone.
- **The Novabot stock app is third-party software.** OpenNova mimics the cloud API so closely that the stock app usually works unchanged, but new app versions occasionally break things. The [OpenNova app](../guide/app-updates.md) is our own community build that we control end-to-end.
