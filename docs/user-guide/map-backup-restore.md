## What this covers

A complete backup of all map state (polygons, raster, dock pose, UTM anchor) and
restore that brings the mower back to a usable mowing state, even when the
local map frame has shifted between export and restore.

## Glossary

- **Bundle** (`.novabotmap`): zip with `metadata.json`, `polygon.json`, `polygons.json`,
  `obstacles.json`, `unicom.json`, geojson exports, plus a `mower/` tree mirroring
  the mower's on-disk state at export time (csv_file/, charging_station.yaml,
  pos.json, map.yaml/pgm/png, map0/1/2.yaml/pgm/png).
- **csv_file/** and **x3_csv_file/**: same CSV polygon files in two directories
  on the mower. Firmware reads from both depending on code path; always write
  both.
- **charging_pose**: the dock's pose `(x, y, theta_rad)` in the mower's local
  map frame. Stored in `map_info.json` (inside csv_file/) and in
  `/userdata/lfi/charging_station_file/charging_station.yaml`.
- **pos.json** (`/userdata/pos.json`): UTM ↔ local frame anchor. Sets where the
  local frame's `(0,0)` sits in world coordinates.
- **Local map frame**: the coordinate system in which all polygons and dock
  poses are expressed on the mower. Its world anchor is the UTM origin in
  `pos.json`. Re-anchoring after a restore re-derives that origin from the
  dock's RTK-Fixed GPS (`reanchor_pos`); see `docs/reference/REANCHOR.md`. (It
  is NOT pulled back by "ArUco re-alignment" — localization has no ArUco input.)

## Endpoints (server side)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/export-portable` | Download a one-off bundle |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/portable-backups` | Create + retain (auto on every save_map) |
| `GET /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/portable-backups` | List retained snapshots |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/portable-backups/:filename/restore` | One-click restore an existing snapshot (auto-picks verbatim if same SN, else exact) |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/import-portable` | Multipart upload a bundle |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/import-portable/:stagingId/apply-verbatim` | Same-SN restore. Pushes csv_file/, charging_station.yaml, map.yaml/pgm/png + per-slot rasters, **without** touching pos.json. Polygons stay in the bundle's original frame. |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/import-portable/:stagingId/apply-exact` | Cross-frame restore. Reads live `map_position`, computes Δ vs the bundle's `originalChargingPose`, rewrites every CSV point + charging_station.yaml in the current frame. **Does not ship raster** — relies on save_map type:1 (currently broken without an active mapping session, see Known Issues). |
| `POST /api/admin-status/maps/:sn/refresh-dock-anchor` | Trigger dock-cycle to refresh UTM anchor. Modes: `manual` (instruction text) or `auto` (server drives mower 1m back + go_to_charge). |

## Why the dock cycle is the whole game

`pos.json` defines the UTM ↔ local-frame anchor. On any `novabot_launch`
restart `robot_combination_localization` rebuilds its TF graph from scratch
(fresh GPS, fresh IMU bias). The resulting local frame's `(0,0)` may end up
shifted by a meter or two from where it was at export time.

The bundle restore puts polygon CSVs back in their EXPORT-TIME frame. If the
current local frame disagrees, polygons drawn on disk no longer map to the
physical garden the mower is in.

The fix re-anchors the UTM origin in `pos.json` to the dock's true RTK-**Fixed**
GPS, then lets the mower re-lock by driving. **This is GPS/RTK, not ArUco** —
localization has no ArUco input (ArUco only drives the final visual dock
approach). The reliable, explicit version is `reanchor_pos` +
`/load_utm_origin_info`, orchestrated by `POST /api/dashboard/reanchor/:sn`
(`auto`). See `docs/reference/REANCHOR.md` for the full mechanism, the
debunked theories, and why the marker must NOT be recalibrated to chase a bad
frame.

Verified 2026-05-21 on LFIN2230700238: after verbatim restore the mower
reported `map_position = (-2.02, 0.35, -1.59)`; bundle charging_pose was
`(0, 0.06, -1.518)`. After a dock cycle: `map_position = (0.004, 0.110, -1.643)`
≈ origin. **Why it worked (correct attribution):** the drive-off re-init let
`gpsCallback` re-derive the origin from the live GPS — the implicit version of
what `reanchor_pos` now does explicitly. It was NOT an "ArUco snap". (And on a
day the rover was on RTK Float, that same drive re-anchored onto a ~2 m-off fix
— which is the whole reason `reanchor_pos` now gates on a real Fixed.)

## Why we do not ship pos.json in apply-verbatim

Earlier versions shipped bundle pos.json. Problem: bundle pos.json captures
the UTM anchor that was correct AT EXPORT TIME. The mower may have docked
several times since (each rewriting pos.json with newer anchors). Restoring
the old pos.json clobbers progress and creates an immediate frame
inconsistency.

Apply-verbatim now skips pos.json. The mower's own next dock event refreshes
it. Apply-exact has never shipped pos.json (it writes a fresh
charging_station.yaml from live map_position; pos.json stays whatever the
mower already has).

## Why we do not restart novabot_mapping after write_map_files

iceoryx is configured for 50 chunks in the shm pool. Killing
novabot_mapping (and coverage_planner_server, which it depends on) without
clean shutdown leaves chunks stranded. After a couple of restore cycles the
pool fills (50/50 in_use), new processes can't acquire chunks on init, they
crash silently, and robot_decision's health check raises Error 140 every
5 seconds. Recovery requires `systemctl restart novabot_launch` (drains
iox-roudi + restarts every ROS node).

Apply-verbatim and apply-exact both use `restart_mapping: false`. The
firmware's own save_map type:1 + regenerate_per_map_files combo refreshes
caches without bouncing the process.

## Known issues

### Apply-exact does not ship raster

Apply-exact pushes only CSVs (Δ-transformed). It expects `save_map type:1`
to regenerate `map.yaml/pgm/png` from the freshly written CSVs, then
`regenerate_per_map_files` mirrors that into `map0/1/2.yaml/pgm/png`. Live
test 2026-05-21: `save_map type:1` outside an active mapping session
returns `"all the edge data is empty, please recording edge before"` and
writes nothing. After apply-exact from a wiped state the raster files are
missing → Nav2 has no costmap → start_navigation fails.

Workaround: use apply-verbatim (which ships raster directly) for now. To
make apply-exact self-sufficient, server-side raster generation from the
new CSV coordinates would be needed.

### Apply-verbatim must be on same SN

Cross-mower restore via apply-verbatim is blocked unless `?force=1` is
passed. Without the guard the source mower's pos.json (and identity
implications further down the stack) would clobber the target. Use
apply-exact for cross-mower migration — its Δ-rotation produces a
correctly-framed result regardless of source SN.

### Dock-anchor auto mode requires mower already on dock

`refresh-dock-anchor mode=auto` returns 409 if `battery_state != Charging`.
The sequence needs to start from a known-good baseline (mower at dock,
about to drive 1m back). If the mower is already off-dock, just use the
app to send go_to_charge directly.

### Stock binary does not write pos.json on docking

Our open `mower/robot_decision.py:2309` calls `save_utm_origin()` on
`result.code == 100` SUCCESS. The stock binary has the
`save_utm_origin_info` ROS service registered but our live test on
LFIN2230700238 (stock binary) showed pos.json mtime unchanged across a
manual dock cycle. The frame still came back to ~origin — **not via an
"ArUco snap"** (localization has no ArUco input) but because the drive-off
re-init let `gpsCallback` re-derive the origin from the live GPS. The current
re-anchor does this explicitly and works on the stock binary too:
`reanchor_pos` writes pos.json + calls `/load_utm_origin_info` directly, so it
does not depend on the open-decision drop-in. See `docs/reference/REANCHOR.md`.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Sanity check before restoring
curl -s http://<server>/api/dashboard/devices | jq '.[] | select(.sn=="<SN>") | .sensors | {error_status,battery_state,map_position_x,map_position_y}'

# After restore, modal asks for refresh. Manual instructions:
#   Pick the mower up briefly and place it back on the dock, OR use the
#   joystick to drive ~1m off and back.

# Verify after redock
curl -s http://<server>/api/dashboard/devices | jq '.[] | select(.sn=="<SN>") | .sensors | {map_position_x,map_position_y,map_position_orientation}'
# map_position should be within ~10cm of charging_station.yaml charging_pose
```

### Alternative: build a fresh map without driving the mower

If you have an RTK walker handheld, see [RTK Walker mapping](rtk-walker-mapping.md)
for how to record a map by walking the perimeter and importing through the
same restore flow this page describes.

| `/userdata/lfi/maps/home0/csv_file/map_info.json` | bundle |
