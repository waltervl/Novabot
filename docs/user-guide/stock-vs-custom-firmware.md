# Stock vs. Custom Firmware

A common question: **can I use the OpenNova app with the factory (stock) firmware on my mower, or do I need to flash custom firmware first?**

Short answer: the OpenNova app works for everyday mowing on a stock-firmware mower, but several advanced features only work after you flash a custom build. This page is the full breakdown, sourced from the app's call sites (`api.sendExtended` for custom-only paths, `api.sendCommand` for stock-compatible paths) and the extra services that custom firmware installs on the mower.

## Three flavours of "stock"

When this page says "stock" it means the **factory LFI firmware** the mower shipped with — typically `mower_firmware_v6.0.2.deb` (or `v5.7.1` for older units). The factory image talks to `mqtt.lfibot.com` and `app.lfibot.com`. For the app to reach the mower at all, you also need DNS rewrites on your LAN so those hostnames resolve to your OpenNova server.

Two other firmware layers come up:

- **STM32 secondary firmware** — runs on the small microcontroller that drives the blades and reads encoders. Stock STM32 PIN-locks after boot, which blocks several remote commands. The custom STM32 build (`v3.6.11+`) NOPs out the lock check so the mower accepts joystick and blade commands without manual unlock.
- **Charger firmware** — separate ESP32 microcontroller in the charging station. Not addressed here; both stock and custom versions speak the same MQTT/LoRa surface.

## Works on stock (with DNS rewrites)

| Feature | Why it works |
|---------|--------------|
| Mowing start / pause / stop / go-home | Standard MQTT (`start_navigation`, `pause_navigation`, `stop_navigation`, `go_pile`) — stock `mqtt_node` handles these natively |
| BLE provisioning | Pure Bluetooth protocol baked into the mower image, independent of firmware extensions |
| Mapping (creating / editing maps) | BLE-driven (`start_scan_map`, `add_scan_map`, `save_map`); the mower's BLE stack is identical |
| Schedules | Server-side cron, standard `cutGrassPlan` MQTT command |
| Map viewing in the app | The server stores maps; the app reads them via `queryEquipmentMap` |
| Live status — battery / position / work status | Standard `report_state_robot` and `report_state_timer_data` publishes |
| Work history | Standard `saveCutGrassRecord` HTTP POST plus MQTT |
| Messages tab | Server-side `robot_messages` queue |
| Cutting height | Standard MQTT `cutterhigh` enum (still need to send the correct value — see [cutting height notes](../mqtt/mowing-commands.md)) |
| Multi-mower picker | Server-side filter, no firmware involvement |
| Home Assistant integration | Server-side bridge, listens to standard MQTT topics |
| Push notifications | Server-side dispatcher (Expo / NTFY / HA webhook) |
| Stock-style OTA flow | Standard `ota_upgrade_cmd` MQTT — works as long as the firmware download URL is reachable |
| App self-update | App polls `downloads.ramonvanbruggen.nl` directly; no mower involvement |

These are the daily-use features. If all you want is "use my mower without LFI's cloud", stock firmware + DNS rewrites covers it.

## Does **not** work on stock firmware

### Requires `extended_commands.py` (custom-only mower service)

The custom firmware build installs `/root/novabot/scripts/extended_commands.py`, which listens on the `novabot/extended/<SN>` MQTT topic. The app calls these via `api.sendExtended()`. None of them exist on stock firmware.

| Feature | App location | What it does |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Edge cut / boundary mow** | Home → Edge cut | `start_edge_cut` dispatches the `/navigate_through_coverage_paths` NTCP action with `only_edge_mode:true`. Stock has `start_patrol` MQTT but it's a no-op stub. |
| **Stop boundary follow** | Home (kill edge cut) | `stop_boundary_follow` cancels the NTCP goal and any boundary action client |
| **Blade on / off (joystick)** | Joystick screen | `blade_on` / `blade_off` over the serial bus to STM32. No equivalent MQTT command on stock. |
| **Blade speed / blade height direct** | Service tools | Bypasses the standard `cutterhigh` indirection for diagnostics |
| **Camera stream** | Joystick + Camera screens | The MJPEG proxy in the server expects `camera_stream.py` running on the mower — that's also a custom firmware addition |
| **LoRa re-provisioning (server-driven)** | Provision flow fallback | `set_lora_info` when the BLE path fails to push LoRa pair info |
| **Recalibrate charging pose** | Admin → recalibrate | Rewrites three yaml files (`charging_station.yaml`, `auto_recharge_pose.yaml`, `pos.json`) and triggers a node restart |
| **Sync map / apply polygon offset** | Server-side map fixes | Writes the GPS↔map-frame transform into five files so the saved polygon aligns with a freshly-realigned dock |
| **Read / write map files** | Portable map export+import | Direct file IO under `/userdata/lfi/maps/` |
| **Generate empty map / regenerate per-map files** | Map recovery flows | Rebuilds `map.yaml`, `map.pgm`, `map.png` |
| **Get preview cover path / map plan path** | Coverage preview button | Stock `get_preview_cover_path` overruns a buffer on large maps and crashes mqtt_node |
| **Set perception / semantic mode** | Advanced settings | Live-tune obstacle detection level (low/medium/high) |
| **Verify PIN / clear error** | Error recovery | STM32 unlock + chassis-error reset |
| **Get mqtt_node log / ROS logs** | Logs viewer | Tails `/tmp/log_*/log_*.log` over MQTT |
| **Clean OTA cache** | After failed OTA | Wipes `/userdata/ota/cache/` |
| **`is_opennova` detect ping** | Settings → device info | Lets the app auto-detect whether a mower is custom-flashed |
| **Calibration drive** | Initial setup helper | Slow drive-by for heading calibration |
| **Set pos origin** | Map fix tooling | Forces `pos.json` origin to a known point |
| **Reboot mower** | Admin → reboot | `handle_reboot` reboots cleanly through the daemon-node hook |

### Requires custom STM32 firmware (v3.6.11 or later)

| Feature | Problem on stock STM32 |
|---------|------------------------|
| Manual joystick (`start_move` + `mst`) | Stock STM32 PIN-locks shortly after boot and refuses motor commands. `v3.6.11` NOPs the lock check |
| Blade calibration after boot | Stock STM32 (v3.6.0, v3.6.10) locks blades until the user enters the unlock password — fine for hands-on use, hostile for app-driven control |

The mower's main firmware (the Ubuntu image) and the STM32 firmware are independent. You can run stock STM32 with custom main firmware (or vice versa) but the joystick and blade commands need both to be cooperative.

### Requires the custom server-pointing hooks

These come from `set_server_urls.sh`, `validate_config.sh`, and the `json_config.json` rewriting that the custom firmware installs.

| Feature | Why stock can't do it natively |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Talk to OpenNova as the only server | Stock binds `mqtt.lfibot.com` + `app.lfibot.com` literally. Works around the cloud only when you put DNS rewrites in front of it |
| `opennova.local` hostname-based discovery | Stock doesn't know the hostname |
| mDNS auto-discovery of the OpenNova server | Stock doesn't query `_opennova-http._tcp.local` |
| OpenNova-flavoured OTA flashing | Stock's OTA flow expects the LFI CDN's URL format and presence of certain headers |

## What this means in practice

If a friend asks "can I use OpenNova on my factory mower?", the honest answer:

> Yes, for everything you'd do in the LFI app on a typical mowing day. You lose the joystick (which doesn't work right on stock STM32 anyway), the camera (no `camera_stream.py`), edge-cut (NTCP is a custom thing), and all the recovery / debugging tooling. Flash the custom firmware and all of that comes back, including the option to keep using the LFI app side-by-side.

If you already custom-flashed: you get every feature in the OpenNova app, plus the broker reliability and recovery tooling that prevents the "mower offline after restart" class of bugs (see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)).

## How to check what your mower is running

From the dashboard:

> Devices → click your mower → check the Firmware row.

`v6.0.2` (no `-custom-N`) suffix = stock main firmware. `v6.0.2-custom-32` (or similar) = custom. The STM32 version is on the same panel — anything below `v3.6.11` is stock-locked.

From the mower itself:

    ssh root@<mower-ip>
    cat /etc/issue   # mower's Ubuntu image version
    cat /userdata/ota/custom_firmware.log | tail -5   # only exists on custom builds
