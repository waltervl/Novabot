# OpenNova App

The OpenNova app is the community-built replacement for the stock Novabot app. It connects to your OpenNova server (not the LFI cloud) and gives you everything the original app does — pairing, mapping, mowing, schedules, history — plus a handful of features the stock app doesn't (Home Assistant push, multi-mower picker, joystick mode, demo mode).

Install on Android: download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/rvbcrs/Novabot/releases). Install on iOS: TestFlight invite from the maintainer — Apple doesn't allow direct APK-style installs.

This page walks through what each screen does. Screens appear in the order you'd typically use them.

## Login

Email + password (the same account you created on the OpenNova server admin page). After first login the app remembers you — you only see this screen again if you log out or change devices.

If login fails with "network connection abnormal":
- The server's URL in app settings is wrong, or
- DNS isn't routing `app.lfibot.com` (or your custom hostname) to your server, or
- iOS-only: the server's TLS cert isn't trusted — install the OpenNova CA from the admin panel's Certificate Setup card.

## Device picker (top of Home)

Tap the chevron next to your mower's name to switch between paired mowers. The picker shows online state with a dot — green = receiving status, grey = offline.

If you only have one mower, the picker shows that mower's name as a static title.

## Home

The default screen after login. Shows everything happening with the active mower right now:

- **Battery ring** — current % and a thin coloured arc indicating charge state.
- **Mower scene** — a stylised top-down picture of the mower with status indicators (motors running, blades spinning, error states overlay).
- **Action row** — large buttons for the common operations:
  - **Start mowing** — opens the StartMowSheet (pick which map, blade height, edge-only mode).
  - **Pause / Resume** — only enabled mid-session.
  - **Go home / Charge** — sends the mower back to the charger.
  - **Edge cut** — boundary-only mowing pass (uses the NTCP action behind the scenes; "start_patrol" in the stock app does *not* do this — that's a no-op).
- **Schedule chip** — shows the next scheduled mow. Tap to jump to the Schedule screen.
- **Live updates** — battery, position, work status all refresh from MQTT every couple of seconds while the screen is open.

Pull down to manually refresh the whole screen.

## Start Mowing sheet

Slides up from the bottom when you tap **Start mowing**. Choose:

- **Map** — pick one of your work maps or "All maps" (selects every work area on the mower).
- **Cutting height** — slider in cm. Valid range 2-9 cm. Values outside this range are silently rejected by the firmware, so the slider clamps for you.
- **Edge first** — toggle to mow the boundary before filling the interior.
- **Rain delay** — if enabled, the mower won't start while the rain sensor is wet.

Hit **Confirm** and the mower starts within a few seconds (the command goes via MQTT, then ROS).

## Map

Live position view. Your mower's last known location is plotted on top of the work map polygons. Tracks the mower's path during an active mowing session.

- **Switch map** — pick which work map to display.
- **Manual control** — opens the Joystick screen (see below).
- **Mapping** — opens the Mapping flow to add / edit a map.

## Mapping

Walks you through creating a new map (or editing an existing one). Steps:

1. **Pair via BLE** — app talks directly to the mower over Bluetooth for the duration of the mapping session. Make sure your phone is within range.
2. **Drive the boundary** — joystick controls; trace the outer edge of the area you want mowed.
3. **Add obstacles** — pause-resume cycles to mark trees, beds, statues. Each obstacle is a closed polygon inside the work area.
4. **Add unicom channels** (optional) — narrow paths the mower uses to travel between work areas without mowing.
5. **Set charger position** — drive the mower onto the charger and confirm; this becomes the reference point for the map's GPS-to-local coordinate transform.
6. **Save** — sends two `save_map` calls (sub map + total map) and uploads the resulting CSV to the server. Don't close the app between the two sends.

The full BLE protocol details (for debugging) live at [BLE → Mower Provisioning](../ble/mower-provisioning.md), but you don't need to read it for normal use.

## Schedule

Recurring mowing schedules per map. Each schedule has:

- Days of week (any combination).
- Start time.
- Map(s) to mow.
- Cutting height.
- Edge-first toggle.
- Optional rain pause.

Add, edit, delete from the same screen. Schedules execute server-side — the mower keeps mowing on schedule even if your phone is asleep or the app is closed.

## History (Work records)

Past mowing sessions. Each row:

- Date & time (in your phone's timezone).
- Duration (minutes).
- Area mowed (m²).
- Map(s) used.
- Status (completed / interrupted / cancelled).
- Start method (manual / scheduled / app).

Tap a row to see the path the mower took during that session, plotted on the map.

## Messages

Robot messages + alerts: low battery, blade stuck, lifted off ground, lost localization, recharge requested. The Messages tab is a **poll-based inbox** (the app fetches the server's stored `robot_messages` queue on open / refresh); it is not a push channel. For real-time push (the OS-level pop-up while the app is closed), see the Notifications section below and the [Notifications setup](../guide/notifications.md) page.

Tap a message to see full detail. Swipe to delete. "Mark all read" button at the top.

## Joystick

Manual remote control. The mower must be in manual mode (which the app sets via `start_move`).

- Left stick — forward / back.
- Right stick — turn.
- Tap-to-stop — instant stop.
- Blade toggle — turn blades on/off independently of motion (so you can spot-trim).

Lose connection mid-control and the mower auto-stops within a couple of seconds — there's no runaway risk.

## Camera

Live camera feed from the mower's onboard camera. Only available on hardware revisions that have a camera fitted.

## OTA

Firmware updates from inside the app. Lists available versions with changelog, picks the latest by default, "Update" button kicks off the OTA.

The OpenNova server (not the LFI cloud) serves the firmware files. Watch the percentage — see [Troubleshooting → OTA failures](troubleshooting.md#ota-update-fails-download-failed-percentage-stuck-below-62) if it gets stuck.

## Settings

App-level settings (different from mower settings):

- **Server URL** — which OpenNova server the app talks to. Default is `https://app.lfibot.com` (auto-discovered if your DNS is set up); override manually for non-standard setups.
- **Language** — UI language.
- **Theme** — light / dark / system.
- **Notifications** — opt-in for push notifications via Expo (mowing started/finished, low battery, errors). Requires the server's notification dispatcher to be configured ([Notifications setup](../guide/notifications.md)).
- **Demo mode** — fake mower + map for screenshots / testing. Does not touch real hardware.
- **About / Logout** — version info, log out, support links.

## Mower Settings (per-device)

Reached from the device picker or the gear icon on the device card. Per-device knobs:

- **Nickname** — what the mower shows up as in the app.
- **Auto-recharge threshold** — battery % at which the mower returns to base.
- **Rain delay** — how long to wait after rain before resuming.
- **Mowing speed** — slider (clamped by firmware).
- **Blade calibration** — if your blades drift left/right, nudge here.

Changes save instantly via MQTT — no separate "Save" button.

## App updates

The Android app polls `downloads.ramonvanbruggen.nl` every time it foregrounds and every 12 hours in the background for new releases. When one is available, you get a one-tap install prompt with the changelog.

iOS users get the same prompt but it links to TestFlight / the GitHub release page — Apple doesn't allow auto-install from outside the App Store.

## When the app can't connect

In order from "most common" to "least":

1. Server URL or DNS isn't pointing at your OpenNova instance. Open Settings → Server URL and check.
2. (iOS only) TLS cert not trusted. Install the OpenNova CA from the admin Certificate Setup card.
3. Your phone is on a different VLAN than the server (guest WiFi often does this).
4. Server container is down (`docker ps` on the host).

The [Troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md) has a deeper dive into each.
