# Troubleshooting

Common problems and how to fix them. If your symptom isn't here, search [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rvbcrs/Novabot/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before filing a new one — there's a good chance someone hit the same thing.

## My mower shows up as "offline" in the app

Most common cause by far. The mower's `mqtt_node` can't reach your MQTT broker.

**Check in this order:**

1. **Is the OpenNova server itself running?**
   ```
   docker ps | grep opennova
   ```
   Should show one container, status `Up`. If it says `Restarting`, run `docker logs opennova 2>&1 | tail -50` to see why.

2. **Can the mower reach the server on port 1883?**
   ```
   ssh root@<mower-ip>
   nc -zv <server-ip> 1883
   ```
   Connection refused / timeout = your network is blocking traffic between mower and server. Most likely culprits: a VLAN/firewall split between WiFi devices, or Mac/Windows Docker Desktop where the container is hidden behind a VM.

3. **What does the mower think the server address is?**
   ```
   cat /userdata/lfi/json_config.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('mqtt',{}).get('value',{}))"
   cat /userdata/lfi/http_address.txt
   ```
   The `addr` field should be your server's LAN IP. If it says `mqtt.lfibot.com` or `127.0.0.1` or an unrelated IP, the mower never picked up the local-cloud config. Re-run the discovery script:
   ```
   bash /root/novabot/scripts/set_server_urls.sh
   ```

4. **Is DNS set up?** If the mower resolves `mqtt.lfibot.com` to LFI's old cloud IP (or NXDOMAIN), it'll never even try your server. The admin page has a "Network & DNS" card that tests this for you.

5. **Did the MQTT broker get stuck?** Specific symptom: `mqtt_node` is alive on the mower, but logs show endless `MQTT_EVENT_INIT_NET_ERROR`. The ESP-IDF MQTT stack inside the firmware can get into a stuck state after the server restarts. Fix:
   ```
   ssh root@<mower-ip> 'bash /root/novabot/scripts/set_server_urls.sh'
   ```
   Re-running the script clears the stuck state without rebooting.

## The app shows "No map!" even though I made a map

The map upload completed on the mower side, but `queryEquipmentMap` returned an empty array.

- Check the admin page → Devices → click the mower. The "Maps" section there reads straight from the database. If the dashboard sees maps but the app doesn't, it's an app-side filter — usually because the work map has a `mapArea` of zero or canonical_name is missing. Map again with the mower idle on flat ground.
- If the dashboard also shows no maps: the mower never finished the upload. Look at the mower log around the moment you finished mapping — search for `uploadEquipmentMap`. If you don't see that POST hitting the server, the mower didn't try; if you see it but the response was non-2xx, the server rejected it — file a bug with the log.

## Mower won't accept the cutting height I set

The mower uses a wire-level enum, not centimeters. The display you see (e.g. "4 cm") is `wire + 2`. So:

- App sends user-cm = 4 → server / firmware stores `cutterhigh = 2` → blades land at 40 mm.
- Valid range: 2-9 cm in the app (wire 0-7 in firmware).
- If you set 10 cm or higher, the firmware silently rejects it and the blades stay where they were.

If your blade height "doesn't change", check the mower SSH log:
```
grep BLADE_HEIGHT_GET /tmp/log_*/log_mqtt_node.log
```
The number printed there is the actual height in millimeters. If it stays at the previous value across multiple BLADE_HEIGHT_GET lines, the firmware rejected your value.

## "Edge cut" or "Boundary cut" never starts

Use the dashboard or app's "Edge cut" button, not "Start patrol". Stock `start_patrol` MQTT is a no-op stub in `mqtt_node` — it returns "OK" but does nothing.

If the button is there and you click it but the mower stays put:
- Make sure the mower is on the map you want to edge (not just near it).
- Look at the mower log for `Only edge mode, only covering boundary path` — that line means the firmware accepted the command. If you don't see it, the request never reached the action server.
- A `localization not initialized` warning right after pressing the button is OK — the firmware does a 1-metre drive-back to self-initialize before starting.

## OTA update fails ("download failed", percentage stuck below 62%)

Things to check:

1. The firmware download URL must be **http://** (not https://). The mower's downloader does not do TLS.
2. The download URL must be reachable from the mower:
   ```
   ssh root@<mower-ip>
   curl -I http://<server-ip>:<port>/api/dashboard/firmware/<file>.deb
   ```
   You should see `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` or `206 Partial Content`. A 404 means the file isn't where the server says it is.
3. The OTA payload **must not** contain a `tz` field. If you see `"type":"increment"` in your MQTT log instead of `"type":"full"`, something is injecting `tz` and breaking the parse. The server's MQTT broker has a guard for this; if you bypassed it, payloads will fail.

Percentage meaning so you know which phase failed:

| % | Phase |
|---|-------|
| 0 – 62 | Download |
| 62 – 68 | Unpacking |
| 68 – 100 | Installing |

The 62 → 68 jump is suspicious if it happens too fast — that usually means the .deb is corrupt.

## "Charger offline" but the LED on the charger is solid green

The charger's LoRa link with the mower is working but its WiFi/MQTT link to the server isn't.

- Check the charger MQTT address — same `json_config.json` flow as the mower but on the charger's ESP32. The factory address is `mqtt.lfibot.com`; OpenNova re-provisions it during pairing.
- If the charger was paired before but stopped reporting, re-do BLE provisioning from the OpenNova / Novabot app and pick the same network.

## After OTA the mower drives but won't cut

Most likely the STM32 (the secondary microcontroller that runs the blades) got into PIN-lock mode. Symptoms: motors work, drive works, but blades never spin and the dashboard shows `error_status=151`.

Power-cycle the mower (not just reboot, full power off, wait 10 s, power on). The PIN lock clears at cold boot. Current stock STM32 `v3.6.0` does not have the PIN-lock bug, so if blades still refuse to spin after a cold boot the cause is elsewhere (look at the mower log for the actual error rather than chasing the STM32).

## "Localization not initialized" before the first mow of the day

Not a bug. The mower drives back ~1 m on startup to acquire GPS heading. Once it logs `LOC_SUCCESS` the warning goes away — usually within a few seconds. If it stays warning for minutes:

- GPS view of the sky is blocked (under a deck, indoor, dense trees).
- RTK correction stream from the charger isn't reaching it. Check the charger is online and that the RTK link is healthy (LoRa packet rate visible on the admin page).

## I bricked something and the mower won't boot

Two recovery levers:

1. **Ethernet fallback**. The custom firmware sets `eth0` to `192.168.1.10/24` every boot. Plug an Ethernet cable into the mower, set your laptop to `192.168.1.20/24`, and SSH to `192.168.1.10`.
2. **Reinstall a known-good `.deb`**. Either re-flash via the ESP32 OTA tool (puts a `.deb` on the SD card and pushes it over MQTT), or SSH in and `dpkg -i` a manually-uploaded firmware package:
   ```
   scp mower_firmware_v6.0.2-custom-NN.deb root@<mower-ip>:/tmp/
   ssh root@<mower-ip> 'dpkg -i /tmp/mower_firmware_v6.0.2-custom-NN.deb'
   ```
   The mower keeps no built-in factory backup, so always hold onto a working `.deb` somewhere off the device.

If neither works: open an issue with the symptoms and `dmesg | tail -100`. Don't reflash blindly — the wrong firmware on the wrong hardware (LFIN1 vs LFIN2 platforms) can semi-brick the unit.

## How to gather logs to attach to a bug report

The fastest way is the **Remote Debug** card in the admin page → "Start Sharing" → paste the relay URL the person helping you provided. That streams your live MQTT log to them without giving up control of the container.

For a static snapshot:
```
docker logs opennova 2>&1 | tail -500 > /tmp/opennova-server.log
ssh root@<mower-ip> 'tail -200 /tmp/log_*/log_mqtt_node.log' > /tmp/opennova-mower.log
```
Attach both files to the GitHub issue. Redact email addresses and serial numbers if you don't want them public — the issue template has a checkbox reminder for this.
